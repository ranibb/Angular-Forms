## A basic Express Server

Setup a server that can receive the form data.

* Initilzie a new package.json by running the command `npm init`.
* Install the dependances `npm install --save express body-parser cors`.

express is our webserver, body-parser is the middleware to handle form data and cors is a package to make requests across different ports.
